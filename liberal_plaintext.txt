had the manifestation of nuit the unveiling of the company of heaven every man and every woman is a star every number is infinite there is no difference help me o warrior lord of thebes in my unveiling before the children of men be thou hadit my secret centre my heart & my tongue behold it is revealed by aiwass the minister of hoor-paar-kraat the khabs is in the khu not the khu in the khabs worship then the khabs and behold my light shed over you let my servants be few & secret they shall rule the many & the known these are fools that men adore both their gods & their men are fools come forth o children under the stars & take your fill of love i am above you and in you my ecstasy is in yours my joy is to see your joy above the gemmed azure is the naked splendour of nuit she bends in ecstasy to kiss the secret ardours of hadit the winged globe the starry blue are mine o ankh-af-na-khonsu now ye shall know that the chosen priest & apostle of infinite space is the prince-priest the beast and in his woman called the scarlet woman is all power given they shall gather my children into their fold they shall bring the glory of the stars into the hearts of men for he is ever a sun and she a moon but to him is the winged secret flame and to her the stooping starlight but ye are not so chosen burn upon their brows o splendrous serpent o azure-lidded woman bend upon them the key of the rituals is in the secret word which i have given unto him with the god & the adorer i am nothing they do not see me they are as upon the earth i am heaven and there is no other god than me and my lord hadit now therefore i am known to ye by my name nuit and to him by a secret name which i will give him when at last he knoweth me since i am infinite space and the infinite stars thereof do ye also thus bind nothing let there be no difference made among you between any one thing & any other thing for thereby there cometh hurt but whoso availeth in this let him be the chief of all i am nuit and my word is six and fifty divide add multiply and understand then saith the prophet and slave of the beauteous one who am i and what shall be the sign so she answered him bending down a lambent flame of blue all-touching all penetrant her lovely hands upon the black earth & her lithe body arched for love and her soft feet not hurting the little flowers thou knowest and the sign shall be my ecstasy the consciousness of the continuity of existence the omnipresence of my body then the priest answered & said unto the queen of space kissing her lovely brows and the dew of her light bathing his whole body in a sweet-smelling perfume of sweat o nuit continuous one of heaven let it be ever thus that men speak not of thee as one but as none and let them speak not of thee at all since thou art continuous none breathed the light faint & faery of the stars and two for i am divided for love's sake for the chance of union this is the creation of the world that the pain of division is as nothing and the joy of dissolution all for these fools of men and their woes care not thou at all they feel little what is is balanced by weak joys but ye are my chosen ones obey my prophet follow out the ordeals of my knowledge seek me only then the joys of my love will redeem ye from all pain this is so i swear it by the vault of my body by my sacred heart and tongue by all i can give by all i desire of ye all then the priest fell into a deep trance or swoon & said unto the queen of heaven write unto us the ordeals write unto us the rituals write unto us the law but she said the ordeals i write not the rituals shall be half known and half concealed the law is for all this that thou writest is the threefold book of law my scribe ankh-af-na-khonsu the priest of the princes shall not in one letter change this book but lest there be folly he shall comment thereupon by the wisdom of ra-hoor-khuit also the mantras and spells the obeah and the wanga the work of the wand and the work of the sword these he shall learn and teach he must teach but he may make severe the ordeals the word of the law is thelema who calls us thelemites will do no wrong if he look but close into the word for there are therein three grades the hermit and the lover and the man of earth do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the law the word of sin is restriction o man refuse not thy wife if she will o lover if thou wilt depart there is no bond that can unite the divided but love all else is a curse accursed accursed be it to the aeons hell let it be that state of manyhood bound and loathing so with thy all thou hast no right but to do thy will do that and no other shall say nay for pure will unassuaged of purpose delivered from the lust of result is every way perfect the perfect and the perfect are one perfect and not two nay are none nothing is a secret key of this law sixty-one the jews call it i call it eight eighty four hundred & eighteen but they have the half unite by thine art so that all disappear my prophet is a fool with his one one one are not they the ox and none by the book abrogate are all rituals all ordeals all words and signs ra-hoor-khuit hath taken his seat in the east at the equinox of the gods and let asar be with isa who also are one but they are not of me let asar be the adorant isa the sufferer hoor in his secret name and splendour is the lord initiating there is a word to say about the hierophantic task behold there are three ordeals in one and it may be given in three ways the gross must pass through fire let the fine be tried in intellect and the lofty chosen ones in the highest thus ye have star & star system & system let not one know well the other there are four gates to one palace the floor of that palace is of silver and gold lapis lazuli & jasper are there and all rare scents jasmine & rose and the emblems of death let him enter in turn or at once the four gates let him stand on the floor of the palace will he not sink amn ho warrior if thy servant sink but there are means and means be goodly therefore dress ye all in fine apparel eat rich foods and drink sweet wines and wines that foam also take your fill and will of love as ye will when where and with whom ye will but always unto me if this be not aright if ye confound the space-marks saying they are one or saying they are many if the ritual be not ever unto me then expect the direful judgments of ra hoor khuit this shall regenerate the world the little world my sister my heart & my tongue unto whom i send this kiss also o scribe and prophet though thou be of the princes it shall not assuage thee nor absolve thee but ecstasy be thine and joy of earth ever to me to me change not as much as the style of a letter for behold thou o prophet shalt not behold all these mysteries hidden therein the child of thy bowels he shall behold them expect him not from the east nor from the west for from no expected house cometh that child aum all words are sacred and all prophets true save only that they understand a little solve the first half of the equation leave the second unattacked but thou hast all in the clear light and some though not all in the dark invoke me under my stars love is the law love under will nor let the fools mistake love for there are love and love there is the dove and there is the serpent choose ye well he my prophet hath chosen knowing the law of the fortress and the great mystery of the house of god all these old letters of my book are aright but 90 is not the star this also is secret my prophet shall reveal it to the wise i give unimaginable joys on earth certainty not faith while in life upon death peace unutterable rest ecstasy nor do i demand aught in sacrifice my incense is of resinous woods & gums and there is no blood therein because of my hair the trees of eternity my number is 11 as all their numbers who are of us the five pointed star with a circle in the middle & the circle is red my colour is black to the blind but the blue & gold are seen of the seeing also i have a secret glory for them that love me but to love me is better than all things if under the night stars in the desert thou presently burnest mine incense before me invoking me with a pure heart and the serpent flame therein thou shalt come a little to lie in my bosom for one kiss wilt thou then be willing to give all but whoso gives one particle of dust shall lose all in that hour ye shall gather goods and store of women and spices ye shall wear rich jewels ye shall exceed the nations of the earth in splendour & pride but always in the love of me and so shall ye come to my joy i charge you earnestly to come before me in a single robe and covered with a rich headdress i love you i yearn to you pale or purple veiled or voluptuous i who am all pleasure and purple and drunkenness of the innermost sense desire you put on the wings and arouse the coiled splendour within you come unto me at all my meetings with you shall the priestess say  and her eyes shall burn with desire as she stands bare and rejoicing in my secret temple  to me to me calling forth the flame of the hearts of all in her love-chant sing the rapturous love-song unto me burn to me perfumes wear to me jewels drink to me for i love you i love you i am the blue-lidded daughter of sunset i am the naked brilliance of the voluptuous night-sky to me to me the manifestation of nuit is at an end   nu the hiding of hadit come all ye and learn the secret that hath not yet been revealed i hadit am the complement of nu my bride i am not extended and khabs is the name of my house in the sphere i am everywhere the centre as she the circumference is nowhere found yet she shall be known & i never behold the rituals of the old time are black let the evil ones be cast away let the good ones be purged by the prophet then shall this knowledge go aright i am the flame that burns in every heart of man and in the core of every star i am life and the giver of life yet therefore is the knowledge of me the knowledge of death i am the magician and the exorcist i am the axle of the wheel and the cube in the circle "come unto me" is a foolish word for it is i that go who worshipped heru-pa-kraath have worshipped me ill for i am the worshipper remember all ye that existence is pure joy that all the sorrows are but as shadows they pass & are done but there is that which remains o prophet thou hast ill will to learn this writing i see thee hate the hand & the pen but i am stronger because of me in thee which thou knewest not for why because thou wast the knower and me now let there be a veiling of this shrine now let the light devour men and eat them up with blindness for i am perfect being not and my number is nine by the fools but with the just i am eight and one in eight which is vital for i am none indeed the empress and the king are not of me for there is a further secret i am the empress & the hierophant thus eleven as my bride is eleven hear me ye people of sighing the sorrows of pain and regret are left to the dead and the dying the folk that not know me as yet these are dead these fellows they feel not we are not for the poor and sad the lords of the earth are our kinsfolk is a god to live in a dog no but the highest are of us they shall rejoice our chosen who sorroweth is not of us beauty and strength leaping laughter and delicious languor force and fire are of us we have nothing with the outcast and the unfit let them die in their misery for they feel not compassion is the vice of kings stamp down the wretched & the weak this is the law of the strong this is our law and the joy of the world think not o king upon that lie that thou must die verily thou shalt not die but live now let it be understood if the body of the king dissolve he shall remain in pure ecstasy for ever nuit hadit ra-hoor-khuit the sun strength & sight light these are for the servants of the star & the snake i am the snake that giveth knowledge & delight and bright glory and stir the hearts of men with drunkenness to worship me take wine and strange drugs whereof i will tell my prophet & be drunk thereof they shall not harm ye at all it is a lie this folly against self the exposure of innocence is a lie be strong o man lust enjoy all things of sense and rapture fear not that any god shall deny thee for this i am alone there is no god where i am behold these be grave mysteries for there are also of my friends who be hermits now think not to find them in the forest or on the mountain but in beds of purple caressed by magnificent beasts of women with large limbs and fire and light in their eyes and masses of flaming hair about them there shall ye find them ye shall see them at rule at victorious armies at all the joy and there shall be in them a joy a million times greater than this beware lest any force another king against king love one another with burning hearts on the low men trample in the fierce lust of your pride in the day of your wrath ye are against the people o my chosen i am the secret serpent coiled about to spring in my coiling there is joy if i lift up my head i and my nuit are one if i droop down mine head and shoot forth venom then is rapture of the earth and i and the earth are one there is great danger in me for who doth not understand these runes shall make a great miss he shall fall down into the pit called because and there he shall perish with the dogs of reason now a curse upon because and his kin may because be accursed for ever if will stops and cries why invoking because then will stops & does nought if power asks why then is power weakness also reason is a lie for there is a factor infinite & unknown & all their words are skew-wise enough of because be he damned for a dog but ye o my people rise up & awake let the rituals be rightly performed with joy & beauty there are rituals of the elements and feasts of the times a feast for the first night of the prophet and his bride a feast for the three days of the writing of the book of the law a feast for tahuti and the child of the prophet secret o prophet a feast for the supreme ritual and a feast for the equinox of the gods a feast for fire and a feast for water a feast for life and a greater feast for death a feast every day in your hearts in the joy of my rapture a feast every night unto nu and the pleasure of uttermost delight aye feast rejoice there is no dread hereafter there is the dissolution and eternal ecstasy in the kisses of nu there is death for the dogs dost thou fail art thou sorry is fear in thine heart where i am these are not pity not the fallen i never knew them i am not for them i console not i hate the consoled & the consoler i am unique & conqueror i am not of the slaves that perish be they damned & dead amen this is of the 4 there is a fifth who is invisible & therein am i as a babe in an egg blue am i and gold in the light of my bride but the red gleam is in my eyes & my spangles are purple & green purple beyond purple it is the light higher than eyesight there is a veil that veil is black it is the veil of the modest woman it is the veil of sorrow & the pall of death this is none of me tear down that lying spectre of the centuries veil not your vices in virtuous words these vices are my service ye do well & i will reward you here and hereafter fear not o prophet when these words are said thou shalt not be sorry thou art emphatically my chosen and blessed are the eyes that thou shalt look upon with gladness but i will hide thee in a mask of sorrow they that see thee shall fear thou art fallen but i lift thee up nor shall they who cry aloud their folly that thou meanest nought avail thou shall reveal it thou availest they are the slaves of because they are not of me the stops as thou wilt the letters change them not in style or value thou shalt obtain the order & value of the english alphabet thou shalt find new symbols to attribute them unto begone ye mockers even though ye laugh in my honour ye shall laugh not long then when ye are sad know that i have forsaken you he that is righteous shall be righteous still he that is filthy

lifted up all is ever as it was yet there are masked ones my servants it may be that yonder beggar is a king a king may choose his garment as he will there is no certain test but a beggar cannot hide his poverty beware therefore love all lest perchance is a king concealed say you so fool if he be a king thou canst not hurt him therefore strike hard & low and to hell with them master there is a light before thine eyes o prophet a light undesired most desirable i am uplifted in thine heart and the kisses of the stars rain hard upon thy body thou art exhaust in the voluptuous fullness of the inspiration the expiration is sweeter than death more rapid and laughterful than a caress of hell's own worm oh thou art overcome we are upon thee our delight is all over thee hail hail prophet of nu

comment do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the law the study of this book is forbidden it is wise to destroy this copy after the first reading whosoever disregards this does so at his own risk and peril these are most dire those who discuss the contents of this book are to be shunned by all as centres of pestilence all questions of the law are to be decided only by appeal to my writings
